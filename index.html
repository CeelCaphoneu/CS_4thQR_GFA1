		<H1> Mental Health Advocacy </H1>
		<p> This advocacy aims to bring to light the mental healthcare system in the Philippines and offer support to those struggling mentally. I chose this topic because I believe mental health should be valued and prioritized. Many people struggle with depression and other issues because they do not receive the proper treatment and because they don't know how to take care of themselves. Thus, advocating for this topic allows people to learn more about their mental health. Another reason is that mental health isn't discussed enough. Compared to other countries, our mental healthcare system was only operated quite recently. Lastly, I support this advocacy because it provides support who are struggling and can be a tool for people to connect.  </p>
